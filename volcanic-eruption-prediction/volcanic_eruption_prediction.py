## Introduction
Earthquakes and volcanoes are natural phenomena arising from plate tectonics. Volcanic eruptions are generally accompanied by earthquakes.\n
Earthquakes refer to the trembling or shaking of the Earth’s crust as a result of an abrupt release of energy in the form of seismic waves. These waves are mainly generated by natural phenomena but can also be caused by man-made events. Volcanoes, on the other hand, are openings in the Earth’s crust from which hot gases and molten rock materials are ejected onto the surface of the Earth.

Earthquakes and volcanic activity are closely related to each other. In fact, volcanic eruption are usually accompanied by earthquakes. Similarly, unusual earthquakes can also lead to volcanic eruptions. Before discussing the relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes, let’s learn a bit more about each of them.\n

## Earthquakes
Earthquakes are caused due to a sudden release of accumulated pressure. The generated seismic waves can be measured with the help of a seismometer, indicating the intensity or size of the earthquake.
The size of an earthquake is represented by the moment magnitude scale (MMS); a magnitude of 3 or lower is undetectable, whereas a magnitude equal to or greater than 7 causes maximum damage to life and property. The underground point where this process originates is called the hypocenter or focus. Epicenter refers to the point on the Earth’s surface, which is exactly above the hypocenter.

In this data app, you can retrieve historical data for earthquakes in the island of La Palma (Spain). The data is provided by the Spanish [**National Geographic Institute**](https://www.ign.es/).

## Volcanic Eruptions
Volcanic eruptions are geological processes that involve extrusion of magma. They usually form mountains or mountain-like landscapes after the ejected materials cool down. They can occur in any part of the Earth’s surface, either in land or seas and oceans. Volcanoes are classified into active (eruptive), dormant (presently not active), and extinct (not eruptive) types based on the activeness of a particular volcano. They are further classified into six different types:  submarine, subglacial, shield, cinder, stratovolcano, and supervolcano, depending upon the mode of ejection, among other features.

## How are earthquakes and volcanoes related?
The close relationship between earthquakes and volcanic outbursts is evident from the maps depicting the locations prone to both these phenomena. If you compare the maps that illustrate earthquake zones and volcanic zones, you will find them matching each other. This is because the main theory behind both types of events lies in the plate tectonics.
Planet Earth comprises plates with irregular shapes of different sizes, which constantly move at different speeds. To be precise, the plates drift over the mantle layer of the Earth. Consequently, magma is generated along the plate boundaries. When these plates collide, move apart, or slide with each other, this leads to generation and accumulation of pressure (strain), which when released causes earthquakes. The strongest earthquakes are manifested during the plate collision, while the slowest earthquakes are observed when plates move apart from each other.

Similar to earthquakes, volcanic activity is observed when the plates are divergent (move apart) or convergent (move towards each other). In such plate movements, the magma present in the plate boundaries may rise to the Earth’s surface, leading to volcanic eruptions. Divergent plates may cause long volcanic rifts, whereas convergent plates result in individual volcanic eruptions.\n

We have built a model that uses several features from earthquakes in order to predict volcanic eruptions. In particular, we rely the magnitude and distance measured from different monitoring stations and compute the following features:
1. Minimum amplitude measured
2. Skewness of all amplitudes measured
3. Kurtosis of all amplitudes measured
4. Standard deviation of all amplitudes divided by the distance
5. Kurtosis of all amplitudes divided by the distance

Our model achieves a classification precision of 67%, a recall of 52% and an F-score of 57% on unseen volcanic eruptions. Wanna see it in action?
